# AUSSP-EAGLE-Parts
Contains parts for EAGLE not included in the default libraries.
These parts were made in EAGLE 6, but should be compatible with current versions of EAGLE. They will be missing the 3D attributes used by the 3D renderer in EAGLE 7 and above.

## AS2_AVIONICS_LOGOS.lbr
Contains logos used in the AS-2 days. Not really relevant for new projects, just nice for aesthetics.

## AS-2-Extras.lbr
Contains a lot of random parts made during the AS-2 days. About the only relevant component here is the "INA219" part (current sensors).

## AUSSP_Logo.lbr
Just a logo for AUSSP use. 

## AUSSP_sch_template.lbr
Use this for enclosing your schematics in a pretty, AUSSP-branded, box. This is what is currently in-use for all Avionics designs. 

## adafruit.lbr
A modified version of the Adafruit library available also on Github. In this version, I modified the capacitors so that they include a "tolerance" attribute.
